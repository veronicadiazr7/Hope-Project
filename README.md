**For this project, we were assigned to create an application that will help to raise awareness for oppression, and we were given to implement a  [3rd Party API](https://rapidapi.com/sanglin-TlEqlfGPc/api/energy-price-news/) and an API created by us in our website.**

# About IEPO
*(International Energy Power Organization)*
**IEPO** is a News Organization Website designed to inform the world in just one place without the need to research multiple news platforms to know about the latest updates of energy prices worldwide. **IEPO** additionally is compromised with informing the public of the different incentives available for establishing renewable energy in buildings and other organizations that offer help in ending energy poverty around the world.
## Important Information on how the website was created
- For the **database requirement** we created a Newsletter form that sends the website user's email to our local database. **MySQL** was used as our database management system which was connected to **Node.Js**.
- For the [3rd Party API](https://rapidapi.com/sanglin-TlEqlfGPc/api/energy-price-news/) **requirement** we used **RapidAPI** *Energy Price News* API. To display the 3rd Party API in our front end we used the **Fetch API**. The requests for the articles, regions and sources were located in folders to be more organized.
- For the creation of the **1st Party API requirement** we used Node.Js to create a local server and a JSON file which contains sources of organizations and incentives with the following information: name, a link to their website, and link to their logo image to be displayed in our website.

## Difficulties with the project
 - As always collaborative projects can be complicated due to working in different branches.
- One of the hardest parts was figuring out a solution to display the 3rd Party API on the client side of the website due to it being our first time working alone with 3rd Party APIs but we managed to displayed them correctly.
